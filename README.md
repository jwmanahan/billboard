A collection of resources built to analyze Billboard Top 50 Airplay lists

- I maintain a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2USBpRPrBS3sKOzcucReSh?si=bc5c67c999d54779) with all Billboard Country #1 songs
    - The ipynb file ranks artists by #1 songs using this playlist, including batched extraction of data from the Spotify API

- The Excel file is an analysis of accuracy of Billboard's [stated rules](https://www.billboard.com/billboard-charts-legend/) for removing songs after certain duration, and visualization of trends by song and artist
